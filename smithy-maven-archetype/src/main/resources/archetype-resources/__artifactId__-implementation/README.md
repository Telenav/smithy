$nameCaps Implementation
========================

This project is a place to put your implementations of the service provider interfaces
in the adjacent ${artifactId}-generated-business-logic-spi project.  It is initially
empty, and should be populated with such implementations, which should then be bound
in the server launcher class in the server application project.

When generated from the maven archetype, this project will initially be empty - it is
simply a place to put your implementations as you write them.

This project is set up with the necessary dependencies on its sibling projects; it is
the appropriate place to add dependencies on whatever libraries you want to use in
your implementation.
